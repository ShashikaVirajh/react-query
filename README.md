- This covers, integrating react-query to a react project, handling react-query loading and erros.
- Additionally @rematch/core library has also been integrated to this project.
- React-Query for data fetching and @rematch/core for maintaining a shared state.

NOTE: If the APIs are not working, please add this chrome pluging.
CORS Unblock (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)

Sometimes these APIs are not working. It must be due to the free plan of cocktaildb. Make sure to remove this plugging once the testing is done.

## Tech Stack Used
